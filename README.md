# crypto-trader
This is a command line application for trading different cryptocurrencies that uses real data from an exchange.

## Features ##
The application allows the user to place bids and asks for different crypto currencies on a simulated marketplace.
User orders are processed and matched with orders from the exchange, once an order is complete the user's wallet is updated
to reflect the changes in assets. The simulation has a time concept where the prices of the crypto currencies will change over 
time and thus the user can make a profit or loss after placing different bids and asks.
